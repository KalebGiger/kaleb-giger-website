company: "WSFS Bank"
description: "The app was developed to streamline data entry for customer feedback. Within the app, employees can submit a customer feedback case that contains information pertaining to the case. Once the case is submitted, the case goes through a lifecycle and employees associated with the case must undergo certain procedures for the case to proceed to next steps in the lifecycle.

The app allows you to view live data in the form of pie charts and histograms. The user can then export user specified data as a .csv file, allowing them to further analyze data using Excel."
